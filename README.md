# cloudping
CloudPing uses sensors and microcontrollers to detect rainfall and soil moisture levels. The collected data is transmitted to a cloud platform, enabling remote monitoring through a web or mobile interface. This project aims to support smart farming by conserving water resources and optimizing irrigation schedules.
